## Introduction
This R markdown document shows the data analysis for the series ["Essential and Exposed"](https://cnsmaryland.org/essential-and-exposed/), an investigative project examining the effectiveness of worker protections — or lack thereof — during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The project was created in partnership with the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism, University of Arkansas, Boston University and Big Local News at Stanford University. 

For each sentence in the published stories based on Howard Center data analysis. This document provides links to each story and fact check documents that show the original fact, the code and code output that support that fact, and an explanation where necessary.

## Investigations
